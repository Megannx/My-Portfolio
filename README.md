# My Portfolio

## User Story
Welcome to my portfolio! I'm Megan White, a passionate full-stack developer with a deep-seated desire for coding. My journey began at just the age of 12 when I first discovered the thrill of creating a website from scratch. Since then, I have dedicated myself to mastering both frontend and backend technologies.
I am passionate about creating innovative solutions and am seeking opportunities to collaborate on challenging projects that push the boundaries of technology. Explore my portfolio to see my work in action, or contact me to discuss potential collaborations.
